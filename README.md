# Event Driven Microservices [WIP]
A set of microservices to solve a typical e-commerce business use case.

The goal of this project is to implement the services that compose the UC, providing a communication between them through events, thus making such services more loosely coupled.

Moreover, it's still the intention of this repo to explore a number of frameworks, libraries, good practices and all that involves the usage of microservices architecture to solve modern systems development challenges, using the Java Platform
